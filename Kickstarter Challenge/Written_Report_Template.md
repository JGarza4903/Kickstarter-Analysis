# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To gather data relating to the creation of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends and patterns 

### Purpose

To analyze how different campaigns compared in relation to their ***launch Dates AND Goals*** 

## Analysis and Challenges

To begin analyzing, I populated new data that would give me the _Year_ on which the campaigns started. With that data, I created a pivot table that would show me the  the **Outcomes** and Months of the year to visualize what points throughout the year that had excessive spikes in fundraising as well as months that didn't fare as well. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Looking at the data represented in the Line chart below, we can determine that most Theatre play fundraisers began their campaign near the beginning of summer months.  Those that did have a higher rate of **Success** where as campaigns that start near the end of summer in months like November and December have a lower rate of Success. In comparison, although the data shows a spike in successful campaign during those months, we can also see there is a higher rate of **Failed** campaigns as well.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
