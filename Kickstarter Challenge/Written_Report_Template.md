# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To gather data relating to the creation of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends and patterns 

### Purpose

To analyze how different campaigns compared in relation to their ***launch Dates AND Goals*** 

## Analysis and Challenges

For this analysis I needed to create new data points, from existing data within the main worksheet, to populate the date in a different format. Using New and Existing data we are able use multiple formulas such as _COUNTIF_,_SUM_, and _AVERAGE_ to calculate more useful data we need. I then created visualizations in the form of line charts that show the correlation of Outcomes between ***Launch Date*** and ***Goal***

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To begin analyzing, I populated new data that would give me the _Year_ on which the campaigns started. With that data, I created a pivot table that would show me the  the **Outcomes** and Months of the year to visualize what points throughout the year that had excessive spikes in fundraising as well as months that didn't fare as well.

I was challenged by the formatting of my visual aid, the data didn't look the way I wanted it to due to a filtering issue. It took me quite a while to understand but once I watched over the tutorials again I noticed I missed a helpful tip of clicking on the data itself and sorting it out by left clicking the mouse. Once I figured that out it all made more sense.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I had quite a bit of trouble remembering which characters and columns I needed to imput formulas, I constantly found myslef having to erase the formula and refer back to the main work sheet to find the column or row I needed data from and hand write it to remember.

However, I found a solution. When inputing the formula I can click the cell or worksheet andd it will automatically add it into the formula for me. This made it more efficient to get the analysis finalized in a timely manner.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  1. We can determine that most Theatre play fundraisers began their campaign near the beginning of summer months.  
  
  2. Those that did, have a higher rate of **Success** where as campaigns that start near the end of summer in months like November and December have a lower rate of Success. In comparison, although the data shows a spike in successful campaign during those months, we can also see there is a higher rate of **Failed** campaigns as well. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 

  1. When Comparing the outcome of various campaigns against the goal amount, we can determine that the majority of campaigns had a goal of $10,000 or less. 
  
  2. Those that had lower goal amounts had a higher chance of succeeding while those with a higher goal were more likely to fail, but not in all cases.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
