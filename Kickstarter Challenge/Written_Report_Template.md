# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To gather data relating to the creation of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends and patterns 

### Purpose

To analyze how different campaigns compared in relation to their ***launch Dates AND Goals*** 

## Analysis and Challenges

To begin analyzing, I populated new data that would give me the _Year_ on which the campaigns started. With that data, I created a pivot table that would show me the  the **Outcomes** and Months of the year to visualize what points throughout the year that had excessive spikes in fundraising as well as months that didn't fare as well.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I had quite a bit of trouble remembering which characters and columns I needed to imput formulas, I constantly found myslef having to erase the formula and refer back to the main work sheet to find the column or row I needed data from and hand write it to remember.

However, I found a solution. When inputing the formula I can click the cell or worksheet andd it will automatically add it into the formula for me. This made it more efficient to get the analysis finalized in a timely manner.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  -we can determine that most Theatre play fundraisers began their campaign near the beginning of summer months.  
  -Those that did, have a higher rate of **Success** where as campaigns that start near the end of summer in months like November and December have a lower rate of Success. In comparison, although the data shows a spike in successful campaign during those months, we can also see there is a higher rate of **Failed** campaigns as well. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  -When Comparing the outcome of various campaigns against the goal amount, we can determine that the majority of campaigns had a goal of $10,000 or less. 
  -Those that had lower goal amounts had a higher chance of succeeding while those with a higher goal were more likely to fail, but not in all cases.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
