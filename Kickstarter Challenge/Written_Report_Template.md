# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To gather data relating to the creation of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends and patterns 

### Purpose

To analyze how different campaigns compared in relation to their ***launch Dates AND Goals*** 

## Analysis and Challenges

To begin analyzing, I populated new data that would give me the * *Year* * on which the campaigns started. With that data, I created a pivot table that would show me the **Outcomes**   * *Succeeded, Failed, or Canceled* * and use that data to create a line chart

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
